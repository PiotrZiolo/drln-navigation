# This notebook solves the Banana environment from the Unity ML-Agents for the first project of the [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893).

# ### Load the environment

# In[1]:


from unityagents import UnityEnvironment
import gym
import random
import torch
import numpy as np
from collections import deque
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Fix the dying kernel problem
import os
os.environ['KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK'] = 'True'


# In[2]:


env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="Banana_Windows_x86_64/Banana.exe")


# In[3]:


# get the default brain
brain_name = env.brain_names[0]
brain = env.brains[brain_name]


# ### The game
# 
# The simulation contains a single agent that navigates a large environment.  At each time step, it has four actions at its disposal:
# - `0` - walk forward 
# - `1` - walk backward
# - `2` - turn left
# - `3` - turn right
# 
# The state space has `37` dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  A reward of `+1` is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of `-1` is provided for collecting a blue banana.
